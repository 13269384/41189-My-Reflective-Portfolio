# MY 41189 REFLECTIVE PORTFOLIO

## WEEK 1
### *1.1 What have I learnt this week?*
In reflecting upon this week's tutorial I believe that I have understood the fundamental basics to what systems, complex adaptive systems and socio-technological systems comprise of. After the first lecture, it is now evident to me that defining systems can be very difficult as context changes the meaning of the word. Examples given included, weather systems, Economic systems, clocks and even systems within families. This variety demonstrates that systems penetrate many different sectors of society and that they are everywhere!

### *1.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
I have learnt a great deal in the past week about systems. Upon participating in the first session, I did not have much knowledge about systems other than the technology aspect of systems. Through revision of lecture slides I now know about closed, open and isolated boundaries as well as the characteristics of systems (fig.1). Most notably I learnt about the academic definition of the term ‘complex’ and ‘complicated’.

### *1.3 What insights have I gained?*
A significant realisation made from this week’s lesson is in regards to socio-technical systems. I have become aware that it is important for information system practitioners to consider the societal implications that systems may have. By considering the social framework surrounding a system, such as goals, beliefs and norms, appropriate decisions regarding the technological aspect can be made. 

### *1.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Engaging with the content. |I do not have any prior experience with GitHub, therefore I expect to struggle a little when it comes to creating a repository and uploading content.| 
| I find this subject very interesting therefore I am motivated to learn more.  |  |
 
### *1.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Upon reflection I observed that some challenges faced this week included not knowing anything about GitHub and struggling to upload my work. However, once Juan’s video tutorial was released I found that I was able to easily understand the reason for using Github and how to use it properly. Other issues encountered included not being able to find that textbook on UTS online as there were many different versions, but after speaking to some teammates I was able to locate it and pass the information onto other people struggling. 

### *1.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next week I would like to complete the post work earlier to ensure I keep on top of the workload and have adequate time to process the information and revise before the next lecture.  

### *1.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The theory that proved to be most useful this week was Juan’s tutorial about GitHub. As I have no prior knowledge about it, I found the video to be extremely useful. I learnt that Git is used by many developers and aids in workflow efficiency. GitHub which is what we will use in this course acts as a GUI (graphic user interface), allowing “normal people” to access the data/program from Git.
