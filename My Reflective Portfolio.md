# WEEK 1
### *1.1 What have I learnt this week?*
In reflecting upon this week's tutorial I believe that I have understood the fundamental basics to what systems, complex adaptive systems and socio-technological systems comprise of. After the first lecture, it is now evident to me that defining systems can be very difficult as context changes the meaning of the word. Examples given included, weather systems, Economic systems, clocks and even systems within families. This variety demonstrates that systems penetrate many different sectors of society and that they are everywhere!

### *1.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
I have learnt a great deal in the past week about systems. Upon participating in the first session, I did not have much knowledge about systems other than the technology aspect of systems. Through revision of lecture slides I now know about closed, open and isolated boundaries as well as the characteristics of systems. Most notably I learnt about the academic definition of the term ‘complex’ and ‘complicated’. 
 
### *1.3 What insights have I gained?*
A significant realisation made from this week’s lesson is in regards to socio-technical systems. I have become aware that it is important for information system practitioners to consider the societal implications that systems may have. By considering the social framework surrounding a system, such as goals, beliefs and norms, appropriate decisions regarding the technological aspect can be made. 

### *1.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Engaging with the content. |I do not have any prior experience with GitHub, therefore I expect to struggle a little when it comes to creating a repository and uploading content.| 
| I find this subject very interesting therefore I am motivated to learn more.  |  |
 
### *1.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Upon reflection I observed that some challenges faced this week included not knowing anything about GitHub and struggling to upload my work. However, once Juan’s video tutorial was released I found that I was able to easily understand the reason for using Github and how to use it properly. Other issues encountered included not being able to find that textbook on UTS online as there were many different versions, but after speaking to some teammates I was able to locate it and pass the information onto other people struggling. 

### *1.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next week I would like to complete the post work earlier to ensure I keep on top of the workload and have adequate time to process the information and revise before the next lecture.  

### *1.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The theory that proved to be most useful this week was Juan’s tutorial about GitHub. As I have no prior knowledge about it, I found the video to be extremely useful. I learnt that Git is used by many developers and aids in workflow efficiency. GitHub which is what we will use in this course acts as a GUI (graphic user interface), allowing “normal people” to access the data/program from Git.

# WEEK 2

### *2.1 What have I learnt this week?*
Through careful reflection upon week 2’s content, I believe that the most significant topic I learnt about was the value of a ‘Many Models’ approach. One statistic that stood out to me was about the success in accuracy when a second model and third model was included. These findings concluded that adding a second model led to an 8% improvement, followed by 15% with a third model. Interestly, only several models are needed to increase the improvement amount. For example, having 50 models would yield an improvement so small that it would not be worth the amount of time and energy needed to build this excessive number of models. 
 
### *2.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
I now know about the theory behind the ‘Wisdom of the Crowds’ and how it can be used to calculate (quite accurately) the number of lollies in a jar! However, it was interesting for me to learn that you need lots of diversity in individual people’s answers to make the final answer accurate. When there are many people who all answer the same way,  such as like minded people being all wrong, then this translates to ‘Madness of the Crowds’. 
 
### *2.3 What insights have I gained?*
Further insights gained include awareness regarding biases found in mental models. The ‘Cognitive Bias Codex’, is a visual diagram which lists over 180 mental biases that humans can produce when they have flaws in their thinking or are unaware. It is an extremely useful visual that made me aware of just how many flaws there are to human thought. Ideally, through the use of models and models incorporating diversity I would hope that most biases can be removed. 
 
### *2.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*

 
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Understanding that models are an abstraction of reality. That they represent the key components of whatever the model is based upon. | Understanding the ‘Condorcet Jury Theorem’, proved to be difficult. I believe that I need to spend more time understanding this theorem.| 


### *2.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Small challenges appeared this week such as understanding the theory behind the ‘Wisdom of the Crowds’. It was an extremely new concept to me, therefore I had to carefully go over the pre-work notes and class lecture to piece together the relevant information in order to develop a comprehensive understanding. 
 
### *2.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time I hope to read extra material regarding the specific models and theories presented in class. 
 
### *2.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The 3 theories regarding different approaches to models, have been extremely useful in helping me understand types of models. The embodiment approach is based upon realism and the alternative reality approached does not represent reality. These 2 approaches are polar opposites. However, between these sits the analogy approach which incorporates the essence of reality and aims to provide realistic models based on assumption.

# WEEK 3

### *3.1 What have I learnt this week?*
Upon reflection, the topics covered in week 3’s lecture were an introduction to a variety of models from the ‘Many Models’ approach. They were separated into 5 categories such as modelling how people behave, decide, add power and value, conceal or reveal information and solve problems in groups. By re-reading the lecture content I have come to an understanding regarding the many different forms of representation regarding human thought processes and that the behaviour of people can be modelled to the best of our understanding. 

### *3.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
According to Daniel Kahneman’s non-fiction book ‘Thinking Fast and Slow’, the are two systems within the brain that have different roles in everyday life. System 1 which is used for 90% of the time is fast, automatic and is used to make most of our unconscious decisions such as walking, breathing and simple calculations. However, system 2 is only used the remainder 10% of the time for more complex decisions thus making the thought process time a lot slower than system 1. The benefit of system 2 is that it is reliable and intentional, therefore extremely useful for critical thinking and reflection. In order to write this reflection I am using the ‘system 2’ part of my brain. 

### *3.3 What insights have I gained?*
A significant insight gained after week 3’s lecture was how people add power and value to a situation. The ‘shapley value’, which considers the average added value of a person to a group or team may prove to be very useful in group situations. Conflict can often occur when people feel as though work, money, time and energy have not been distributed evenly, however by utilising the ‘Shapley value’, a solution can be proposed.   
 
### *3.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Understanding the content through the creation of a visual mind map.  | The practical application of some of the models is still slightly vague to me. I understand that in some situations it would be better to use one model rather than another. I am not 100% confident in choosing the most appropriate model. | 
 
### *3.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*

Personal challenges that occurred this week included the amount of content that had to be revised. I found it quite overwhelming as these were totally new concepts to me that I had never encountered before. Each week I feel as though I am learning about new ways to think critically through a many models approach. By the end of the semester I hope to be confident in my ability to analyse the world through a diverse set of models. 
 
### *3.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time I would like to make a list of what context these models are normally used in and then of a few ways that they could be creatively used. I believe that this activity would broaden and diversify my understanding of each model and allow it to be used in creative and innovative ways. 
 
### *3.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The signalling theory has been very useful as it has allowed me to consider the world around me in a more intentional way. Throughout the week, as I left my house, sometimes I would look around me and as myself, “What is this person signalling with this action or object?” By thinking about other people in this way I believe that my ability to be empathetic and understand people in a more humble way shall grow.

# WEEK 4

### *4.1 What have I learnt this week?*
Through critical reflection of this week's teachings, I have learnt a great deal about causal loop diagrams and how relevant they are to everyday life. CLD are a part of system dynamic models that include reinforcing loops and balancing loops. They help us understand the feedback processes and graphically represent the relationship between variables. I believe that CLD are extremely useful as they clearly demonstrate the impact of one variable on another and reveal why something is happening. E.g. Dehydration because someone is not drinking enough water. If they start drinking water they will no longer be dehydrated. 
 
### *4.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
Prior to week 4’s lecture I did not know anything about Agent Based Modelling. However, after reading through the course materials and attending the lecture I am convinced that ABM is an extremely effective modelling method. This effectiveness stems from the fact that ABM allows modellers to observe what is happening, adapt the model and have it learn about its environment. Due to these unique characteristics, ABM shows the emergent qualities of Complex systems. I believe that it is critical to consider the underlying structures and patterns that appear in the real world and ABM provides a way to represent and model the unpredictable behaviour of people and environments. 
 
### *4.3 What insights have I gained?*
A profound insight gained from learning about networking models comes from the example of ‘The power of weak ties’. Learning about the influence that people who are not very close to me have on my life has encouraged me to consider my wider network and not just my immediate friends and family members. It surprised me that some of the best job opportunities come from weak ties as this group of people covers a broader range of individuals who have different experiences to my own. I am very excited to reach out to some of these weaker ties and see what I can learn or gain from these relationships. 

### *4.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
 
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Identifying these models in real life. I believe that I can practically apply and see the networking model to my everyday life.|Understanding some of the mathematics behind the models.|
 
### *4.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Challenges faced this week included managing the workload of this subject and other subjects. I do not believe that I handed the workload very well this week as I was not efficient with my time. Unfortunately, I was not able to follow my uni work schedule which meant that I got a little bit behind on work. 

### *4.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time, I believe that I should delegate set time periods to specific work which will allow me to complete all of my tasks according to schedule. Even if I have not 100% completed weekly activities it may prove a successful method to just start as I found that starting was the hardest part. 

### *4.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The ikea effect theory proved to be useful as it made me reconsider the value I place on objects. Consumers are  constantly encouraged to buy the latest item, which is the most expensive. However, if I am happy to fix or make part of the product myself, I believe that my level of satisfaction could be more than or equal to buying a brand new product.
