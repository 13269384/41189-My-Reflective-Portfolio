# WEEK 1
### *1.1 What have I learnt this week?*
In reflecting upon this week's tutorial I believe that I have understood the fundamental basics to what systems, complex adaptive systems and socio-technological systems comprise of. After the first lecture, it is now evident to me that defining systems can be very difficult as context changes the meaning of the word. Examples given included, weather systems, Economic systems, clocks and even systems within families. This variety demonstrates that systems penetrate many different sectors of society and that they are everywhere!

### *1.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
I have learnt a great deal in the past week about systems. Upon participating in the first session, I did not have much knowledge about systems other than the technology aspect of systems. Through revision of lecture slides I now know about closed, open and isolated boundaries as well as the characteristics of systems. Most notably I learnt about the academic definition of the term ‘complex’ and ‘complicated’. 
 
### *1.3 What insights have I gained?*
A significant realisation made from this week’s lesson is in regards to socio-technical systems. I have become aware that it is important for information system practitioners to consider the societal implications that systems may have. By considering the social framework surrounding a system, such as goals, beliefs and norms, appropriate decisions regarding the technological aspect can be made. 

### *1.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Engaging with the content. |I do not have any prior experience with GitHub, therefore I expect to struggle a little when it comes to creating a repository and uploading content.| 
| I find this subject very interesting therefore I am motivated to learn more.  |  |
 
### *1.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Upon reflection I observed that some challenges faced this week included not knowing anything about GitHub and struggling to upload my work. However, once Juan’s video tutorial was released I found that I was able to easily understand the reason for using Github and how to use it properly. Other issues encountered included not being able to find that textbook on UTS online as there were many different versions, but after speaking to some teammates I was able to locate it and pass the information onto other people struggling. 

### *1.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next week I would like to complete the post work earlier to ensure I keep on top of the workload and have adequate time to process the information and revise before the next lecture.  

### *1.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The theory that proved to be most useful this week was Juan’s tutorial about GitHub. As I have no prior knowledge about it, I found the video to be extremely useful. I learnt that Git is used by many developers and aids in workflow efficiency. GitHub which is what we will use in this course acts as a GUI (graphic user interface), allowing “normal people” to access the data/program from Git.

# WEEK 2

### *2.1 What have I learnt this week?*
Through careful reflection upon week 2’s content, I believe that the most significant topic I learnt about was the value of a ‘Many Models’ approach. One statistic that stood out to me was about the success in accuracy when a second model and third model was included. These findings concluded that adding a second model led to an 8% improvement, followed by 15% with a third model. Interestly, only several models are needed to increase the improvement amount. For example, having 50 models would yield an improvement so small that it would not be worth the amount of time and energy needed to build this excessive number of models. 
 
### *2.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
I now know about the theory behind the ‘Wisdom of the Crowds’ and how it can be used to calculate (quite accurately) the number of lollies in a jar! However, it was interesting for me to learn that you need lots of diversity in individual people’s answers to make the final answer accurate. When there are many people who all answer the same way,  such as like minded people being all wrong, then this translates to ‘Madness of the Crowds’. 
 
### *2.3 What insights have I gained?*
Further insights gained include awareness regarding biases found in mental models. The ‘Cognitive Bias Codex’, is a visual diagram which lists over 180 mental biases that humans can produce when they have flaws in their thinking or are unaware. It is an extremely useful visual that made me aware of just how many flaws there are to human thought. Ideally, through the use of models and models incorporating diversity I would hope that most biases can be removed. 
 
### *2.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*

 
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Understanding that models are an abstraction of reality. That they represent the key components of whatever the model is based upon. | Understanding the ‘Condorcet Jury Theorem’, proved to be difficult. I believe that I need to spend more time understanding this theorem.| 


### *2.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Small challenges appeared this week such as understanding the theory behind the ‘Wisdom of the Crowds’. It was an extremely new concept to me, therefore I had to carefully go over the pre-work notes and class lecture to piece together the relevant information in order to develop a comprehensive understanding. 
 
### *2.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time I hope to read extra material regarding the specific models and theories presented in class. 
 
### *2.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The 3 theories regarding different approaches to models, have been extremely useful in helping me understand types of models. The embodiment approach is based upon realism and the alternative reality approached does not represent reality. These 2 approaches are polar opposites. However, between these sits the analogy approach which incorporates the essence of reality and aims to provide realistic models based on assumption.

# WEEK 3

### *3.1 What have I learnt this week?*
Upon reflection, the topics covered in week 3’s lecture were an introduction to a variety of models from the ‘Many Models’ approach. They were separated into 5 categories such as modelling how people behave, decide, add power and value, conceal or reveal information and solve problems in groups. By re-reading the lecture content I have come to an understanding regarding the many different forms of representation regarding human thought processes and that the behaviour of people can be modelled to the best of our understanding. 

### *3.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
According to Daniel Kahneman’s non-fiction book ‘Thinking Fast and Slow’, the are two systems within the brain that have different roles in everyday life. System 1 which is used for 90% of the time is fast, automatic and is used to make most of our unconscious decisions such as walking, breathing and simple calculations. However, system 2 is only used the remainder 10% of the time for more complex decisions thus making the thought process time a lot slower than system 1. The benefit of system 2 is that it is reliable and intentional, therefore extremely useful for critical thinking and reflection. In order to write this reflection I am using the ‘system 2’ part of my brain. 

### *3.3 What insights have I gained?*
A significant insight gained after week 3’s lecture was how people add power and value to a situation. The ‘shapley value’, which considers the average added value of a person to a group or team may prove to be very useful in group situations. Conflict can often occur when people feel as though work, money, time and energy have not been distributed evenly, however by utilising the ‘Shapley value’, a solution can be proposed.   
 
### *3.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Understanding the content through the creation of a visual mind map.  | The practical application of some of the models is still slightly vague to me. I understand that in some situations it would be better to use one model rather than another. I am not 100% confident in choosing the most appropriate model. | 
 
### *3.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*

Personal challenges that occurred this week included the amount of content that had to be revised. I found it quite overwhelming as these were totally new concepts to me that I had never encountered before. Each week I feel as though I am learning about new ways to think critically through a many models approach. By the end of the semester I hope to be confident in my ability to analyse the world through a diverse set of models. 
 
### *3.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time I would like to make a list of what context these models are normally used in and then of a few ways that they could be creatively used. I believe that this activity would broaden and diversify my understanding of each model and allow it to be used in creative and innovative ways. 
 
### *3.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The signalling theory has been very useful as it has allowed me to consider the world around me in a more intentional way. Throughout the week, as I left my house, sometimes I would look around me and as myself, “What is this person signalling with this action or object?” By thinking about other people in this way I believe that my ability to be empathetic and understand people in a more humble way shall grow.

# WEEK 4

### *4.1 What have I learnt this week?*
Through critical reflection of this week's teachings, I have learnt a great deal about causal loop diagrams and how relevant they are to everyday life. CLD are a part of system dynamic models that include reinforcing loops and balancing loops. They help us understand the feedback processes and graphically represent the relationship between variables. I believe that CLD are extremely useful as they clearly demonstrate the impact of one variable on another and reveal why something is happening. E.g. Dehydration because someone is not drinking enough water. If they start drinking water they will no longer be dehydrated. 
 
### *4.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
Prior to week 4’s lecture I did not know anything about Agent Based Modelling. However, after reading through the course materials and attending the lecture I am convinced that ABM is an extremely effective modelling method. This effectiveness stems from the fact that ABM allows modellers to observe what is happening, adapt the model and have it learn about its environment. Due to these unique characteristics, ABM shows the emergent qualities of Complex systems. I believe that it is critical to consider the underlying structures and patterns that appear in the real world and ABM provides a way to represent and model the unpredictable behaviour of people and environments. 
 
### *4.3 What insights have I gained?*
A profound insight gained from learning about networking models comes from the example of ‘The power of weak ties’. Learning about the influence that people who are not very close to me have on my life has encouraged me to consider my wider network and not just my immediate friends and family members. It surprised me that some of the best job opportunities come from weak ties as this group of people covers a broader range of individuals who have different experiences to my own. I am very excited to reach out to some of these weaker ties and see what I can learn or gain from these relationships. 

### *4.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
 
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Identifying these models in real life. I believe that I can practically apply and see the networking model to my everyday life.|Understanding some of the mathematics behind the models.|
 
### *4.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Challenges faced this week included managing the workload of this subject and other subjects. I do not believe that I handed the workload very well this week as I was not efficient with my time. Unfortunately, I was not able to follow my uni work schedule which meant that I got a little bit behind on work. 

### *4.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time, I believe that I should delegate set time periods to specific work which will allow me to complete all of my tasks according to schedule. Even if I have not 100% completed weekly activities it may prove a successful method to just start as I found that starting was the hardest part. 

### *4.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The ikea effect theory proved to be useful as it made me reconsider the value I place on objects. Consumers are  constantly encouraged to buy the latest item, which is the most expensive. However, if I am happy to fix or make part of the product myself, I believe that my level of satisfaction could be more than or equal to buying a brand new product.

# WEEK 5

### *5.1 What have I learnt this week?*
By reflecting upon this week's lecture I have learnt a great deal about probability and how random the events in our life are. It is astonishing to me that by considering how high a possible outcome is between 0-1, we can determine how probable that event is from occurring. Probability is everywhere in our life from the weather forecast to insurance, sports, advertisement, gambling, banking and even falling in love! By considering my own life and looking back at my decisions, it would be interesting to calculate the probability of me ending up in some other course or university had it been for different choices and outcomes.
 
### *5.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
Prior to the lecture I did not know about normal distribution and the bell shaped curved. The Gaussian distribution model is extremely informative when it comes to demonstrating whether something is “normal” or not because the highest point (central peak) depicts the highest probability of occurrence. Further away from the peak, the probability of occurrence becomes more rare, thus expressing that the outcome is less likely to occur. The normal distribution can be used to demonstrate the IQ, height of people, blood types and student. 
 
### *5.3 What insights have I gained?*
The preferential attachment model has shown me the importance of power-law distributions as this model demonstrates links between different people, events and objects. It was interesting to note that people are very easily influenced by other people’s decisions which can change the popularity of something. Books, music and internet trends are examples of how, if one person buys an object/clicks on a video, then the likelihood of someone else doing the same thing will increase. 
 
### *5.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*

 
|Strengths|Weaknesses|
|Understanding probability and probability distributions. That a sample is a representation of a population  and can never be identical to it.|Applying all the models to my everyday life. I can see a direct correlation between some theory and my everyday life, however I struggle with being able to model it.| 
|Understanding the value of normal distribution, however in manufacturing it is important to reduce the standard deviation in order to minimise waste (six sigma).|

### *5.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
Challenges encountered this week included understanding the power law models. However, after watching the TED talk shown in class about power laws and cities, it became apparent to me that power laws are a very important modelling tool. The versatility of this model to understand the social and environmental implications of certain events such as earthquakes is extremely useful.   
 
### *5.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time I would like to complete this reflection straight after class instead of leaving it for a later date. There is a lot of information to cover and having it fresh in my mind would make writing the reflection a lot easier. 
 
### *5.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The theory about aggregation has been useful as it has provided a more critical understanding of data and its relationship to our world. The emergent properties of systems is a factor that should not be disregarded in modelling as it often provides the most important knowledge and holistic understanding. Aggregation of action encourages us to understand complicated patterns and the interaction between components. Overall, from this theory I have learnt that feedback is extremely important in understanding emergent properties and behaviour.

# WEEK 6

### *6.1 What have I learnt this week?*
Through critical observation of week six’s learning material, it has become clear to me that complex systems evolve over a period of time. Path dependency is one theory which highlights that the outcome depends on a sequence of past outcomes. I strongly agree with this theory as it is true that what is happening now cannot occur without specific choices made in the past. 
 
### *6.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
Interestingly, before this lecture I was not aware that the spread of information or rumours could be modelled. The percolation theory proved to be very interesting as it can model how quickly a rumour spreads. Modelling social phenomena such as human communication and rumours is fascinating as there are so many factors involved. However, percolation suggests that the greater the accumulation in a specific area, the likelihood of percolation also increases. 
 
### *6.3 What insights have I gained?*
I have gained great insight about Wall Street and stocks. The random walk model has made me more critical towards the stock market because it has proved to me that it is extremely difficult to predict what will happen to stocks. Current events in the world immediately affect stocks, therefore unless we can predict the future we will never be able to predict what will happen to the stock market, thus making price changes unpredictable. This theory has proved that it is impossible to beat the market, so maybe becoming a fortune teller compared to a stock analyst would up my chances of making money in the stock market!
 
### *6.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
 
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Understanding random walks and path dependence.| The percolation, diffusion and broadcast models seem to model similar topics, therefore I struggle to understand in what situation it would be best to choose one of them.| 
 
### *6.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
As the deadline for assignment 1 approaches, my team gathered in order to decide on a topic and models. It was difficult to choose an appropriate topic as communication over text was slow. However, we decided on a time to call after class and agreed on a topic and models. Communication was difficult in the beginning but we have decided that talking over MS teams call or Whatsapp group call is more time efficient and effective. 
 
### *6.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time I would like to organise a time to meet with my group a few days in advance. It was a bit stressful as we decided on the day and I had other university commitments. However, I believe that in the future we will definitely communicate better. 
 
### *6.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
After deciding on a topic with my group, I realised that the Markov Model will be extremely useful as it models the likelihood of something moving from one state to another. Our topic is about how the housing market has changed due to Covid-19. Whether people are deciding to sell or not, buy or not. The markov model is perfect for this because we can demonstrate whether people are transitioning from making a choice to sell/buy or not.

# WEEK 7

### *7.1 What have I learnt this week?*
By critically reflecting upon week 7’s lecture content it has become clear to me that culture is a very dynamic and fluid concept that has emergent properties. There are many cultural groups in Australian, which makes this nation multicultural. It is interesting to note that although some people have been born and raised in Australian (like myself), as my father is Japanese I still associate with Japanese culture. Therefore the cultural differences that may emerge as a result of this can be demonstrated as an extension of the pure coordination game. Coordination has a great impact on cultures and what creates cultural difference.  
 
### *7.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
Prior to this reflection it was unclear to me that social learning could be modeled through ‘Replicator Dynamics’.  Some factors that contribute to social learning include behaviour change which can occur through rational strategy or rule-based strategy. Considering these two types I believe that a lot of the decisions that individuals make can be based on rule-based strategy as social choices can influence others greatly. Furthermore, unconscious rules such as social conditioning can also influence social learning. An example of this is that young children are better at representing reality in an abstract way compared to an adult. 
 
### *7.3 What insights have I gained?*
Modelling how people segregate through Schelling’s segregation model has demonstrated to me that people who are similar like to join together in communities. By mapping people’s usual behaviour and rules that they follow, we can create an agent based model which may explain an outcome. If I apply this to my own life, it makes sense to me why I have specific friend groups as our interests are similar. 
 
### *7.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
 
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Identifying how these models can apply to my own life.| Understanding the mathematics behind these models. It would take a lot more research for me to be able to apply these models.|
 
### *7.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
After reflecting on the challenges faced in the previous weeks such as time management, I believe that I have been very effective with my time this week. Instead of writing handwritten notes during the lecture, I immediately wrote them on the computer which has saved me time. I no longer need to retype my notes which has given me more time to revise the content and really understand it. 
 
### *7.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
Next time I would like to write down how I can see some of these models in my everyday life. I believe that this would improve my understanding of many models thinking. 
 
### *7.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The standing ovation theory was very useful as it has provided a lot of information about social cues and why people stand up in a standing ovation. There are many factors which influence how individuals act, making me think that we never really act individually. Is it possible to be an individual? In today’s society the focus on ‘self’ has grown astronomically with people investing in self help books, selfies and solo business ventures. However, agent based models have demonstrated to me that people are susceptible to large peer effects and social influencers as shown in a standing ovation model.

# WEEK 8

### *8.1 What have I learnt this week?* 
Upon critical reflection of this week’s teachings, I have learnt a great deal about complexity and emergent behaviour in a many models thinking approach. Game theories such as strategy, competition and cooperation are evident everywhere in our everyday lives. Models such as the Colonel Blotto model and Prisoners Dilemma models are two of the most well known game theory models which can be applied to many sectors such as finance, sport and health.

### *8.2 What do I 'now know' that I did not before?*
Following the lecture in week 8 I have learnt a great deal about game theory, when previously I had no understanding of the concept. I was not aware that warfare tactics seen in the Colonel Blotto game could be applied to modern day society. The discussion forum also provided excellent questions as it made me reflect upon the colonel blotto game and Covid-19. By critically reflecting, the battle of society against Covid-19 can be seen through the need to reduce community transmission. Fronts such as wearing masks, changing behaviour and social distancing must be won inorder to beat the virus. The structure of the colonel blotto theory is now very clear to me, so much so that I can see how it can be applied to Covid-19, university study (time management) and sport. 

### *8.3 What insights have I gained?*
What has inspired me most this week is the understanding that models cannot demonstrate the unique choices of human beings. For example, the prisoner's dilemma assumes that people will always choose the option that suits them as an individual instead of thinking about the collective. However this is not always the case as people have different morals and values. Some people find more merit in putting others first therefore they would choose to cooperate instead of sacrifice. Unfortunately the prisoner’s dilemma cannot model influencing factors such as a person's ethical perspective.

### *8.4 What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?*
| Strengths     | Weaknesses    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Perseverance in setting up Jupyter notebook and github. Learning how to imbed an image into jupyter notebook. Getting familar with Jupyter lab.|Understanding the mathematics behind the models.|
|Understanding the colonel blotto game and applying it to the current social environment.|
 
### *8.5 What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?*
This week has proven to be extremely difficult as it is the week of submitting the assignment. Fortunately my group has been very organised with delegating parts at the beginning of stuvac and completing them throughout the two weeks prior to submission. Unfortunately I had great difficulty in setting up jupyter notebook with the Github extensions. I found my team to be very supportive in trying to help solve the issue, but it was ultimately Juan’s help that fixed the issue. I believe that we handled this issue very well as we tried our best to sort it out ourselves, but when that proved to be too difficult we consulted our tutor. When we identified that we did not have the skill set to fix the problem we decided to stop wasting time and contact someone who could definitely help up. This method helped us use our time more efficiently, in order to complete the assignment.
 
### *8.6 What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?*
For the next assignment submission there are several parts, therefore it would be a good idea to create a timeline and smaller submission deadlines (within the group). This structure is similar to what we have done for the week 8 submission therefore it should work very well as we have not had any time management issues so far. 
 
### *8.7 What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?*
The colonel blotto game proved to be very useful as it simplified a problem into players and fronts that must be overcome. I have learnt that I can utilise this theory in my everyday life as a form of time management. Working part time, completing uni, playing sport and having a social life are front that must be won in a balanced and healthy way. Using the colonel blotto game to distribute my time and energy to each of these fronts in a realistic way is something that I can consider as troops on a battlefield. 

The prisoner's dilemma has also proved to be useful as it has provided me with a new perspective in the way that a model expects human's to think. However, a model cannot really represent human choice. This week, I was able to identify the Prisoner's Dilemma when watching the 2008 Batman movie, 'The Dark Knight' starring Health Ledger as the Joker. There was a scene whereby the antagonist (the Joker) had set up two ships, one with innocent civilians and the other with prisoners. Each ship had a detonator to the other ship's bomb and if, for example, the civilian ship blew up the prisoner's ship before 12am, then the civilians would be saved. However, if neither side pressed the detonator, they would both explode at 12am. In this situation, the Joker expected one side to blow up the other boat, which is what the Prisoner's Dilemma would infer. However, the moral of this situation was that neither side pressed the detonator and therefore they bested the Joker with human cooperation. In the end none of the ships exploded as it was a bluff made by the Joker who  and in the end none of the ships exploded.
